## Setup

```bash
cp .env-example .env
# Manually add keys for services in .env
npm install
.bin/build  # Just to trigger initial detection of podcasts/videos etc.
.bin/serve
```


## Publishing podcast episodes

 1. `.bin/update_podcast` to add the new episode to podcast.json which can then be committed
    * This allows editing it via the CMS and reduces amount of work for each site build
 2. Add transcript if desired
 3. `.bin/podcast_to_video` to publish to Youtube


## Posting videos to socials

__Facebook__

 * Won't upload large videos (4GB didn't work where as 1GB did, same resolution)
 * But they say they only support up to 720p anyway
 * Use this to reduce size but keep resolution: `ffmpeg -i sj.mp4 -c:a copy sj_reduced.mp4`

__Instagram__

 * Max length 1m30s
 * Ideally 9:16 aspect, or at least 1:1
 * Crop to 9:16 with `ffmpeg -i sj.mp4 -vf crop=1215:2160 -c:a copy sj_insta.mp4`
 * Crop to 1:1 with `ffmpeg -i sj.mp4 -vf crop=2160:2160 -c:a copy sj_insta.mp4`
 * Users scroll through endless videos, so needs to be immediately attention grabbing

__Youtube Shorts__

 * Upload as regular video, but ensure at least 1:1 or vertical aspect
 * Must be less than 1 min

__X__

 * Max resolution is 1080p and audio needs compressing too
 * `ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -s 1080x1920 out.mp4`
