Should a ministry ***relationship***, either in its initiation or
continuation, ever be conditioned on the payment of a fee?

Should the fulfillment of a biblical ***responsibility*** to care
for God's people ever be conditioned on the payment of a fee?

In recent years, many churches and Christians have started
to question modern psychotherapy and return to God's Word as
sufficient for counseling other believers. Although we rejoice
at this development, a related question lurks in the background.
Is it biblical to charge fees for biblical counseling? Is this
question quickly answered "yes" by a simple reference to
scriptures saying the "laborer is worthy of his wages"? (See
Leviticus 19:13, Deuteronomy 24:15, Luke 10:7, Matthew 10:10, 1
Timothy 5:18, 1 Corinthians 9:14.)

Knowing this topic may generate heated debate and
disagreement, I begin with some personal observations as a
former psychologized counselee. My journey through the maze of
psychotherapy ran nearly thirty years. I was much like the sick
woman who came to touch the garment of Jesus after spending all
she had and suffering under the care of doctors who could not
heal her (Mark 5:25-34). I poured out thousands of dollars to
psychiatrists and psychologists who had no answers. The church
sent me away, referring me to "greener" counseling pastures.
Just having a "friend" cost dearly. Is this how God intends for
His undershepherds to care for His sheep? Jesus told John three
times to "feed My lambs" (John 21:15-17). Did He intend for His
lambs to be charged for the meal?

My personal observations do not settle the matter. I offer
them only to provoke discussion, hoping that readers who counsel
will thoughtfully consider the perspective of a weary counselee.
Only God and His Word can answer the question with certainty, so
we must carefully examine the Scriptures.

## I. BIBLICAL CONTENT + BIBLICAL CONTEXT

There are two related, but distinct, issues related to
counseling. First, the content of our counsel must always be
based on God's Word rather than the theories and vain
imaginations of godless men (Freud, Jung, Ellis, Maslow, et al).
Second, the context must also be biblical. I use the term
"context" to refer to such matters as the following:

1. Is the counselor-counselee relationship a personal
   one between two brothers/sisters in Christ, or a
   "professional" one where the counselor maintains a superior
   position and remains aloof outside the counseling room?
2. Does counseling occur inside the church, either
   supervised by its ordained leadership or through informal
   contacts, or in an outside structured biblical counseling
   center which may or may not have some formal relationship
   with the church?
3. Do God's people receive counseling ministry free
   of financial obligation or is it appropriate to charge
   them?

If counseling is to be thoroughly biblical, these issues
must be addressed by Scripture so that both content and context
are consistent with God's sufficient Word. The focus of this
paper is on the third matter. Is it biblically permissible to
charge fees for counseling with biblical content?

## II. BIBLICAL TIMES

In biblical times, there were no "counseling centers" and
no "professional" counselors. If these had existed, it would be
easier to look at how God's people practiced counseling. We
have no verse that explicitly says, "You shall \[or shall not]
charge fees for biblical counseling." However, the New
Testament speaks to pastors and elders who ministered to people
struggling with the same problems that occur today. We should
be able to see how people gave and received counsel in the
church, and how financial support fits into the biblical
picture.

## III. MINISTRY, MOTIVES, AND MONEY

### 1. WHO IS THE "LABORER" WORTHY OF HIS WAGES?

Scripture teaches that an ordained pastor or elder, called
to preach/teach full-time as his life's profession, is entitled
to financial support. More generally, those who hire laborers
must pay their wages in a timely, honest manner. Several
Scriptures teach that the "laborer is worthy of his wages,"
and/or that "you shall not muzzle the ox." Let's examine each in turn.

**Deuteronomy 24:15**: The surrounding context (verses 10-22)
speaks of treating others fairly in financial transactions,
including loans and pledges (24:10-13), paying the wages of
hired servants (24:14-15), and caring for aliens and orphans
(24:17-21). God reminds His people that they were once slaves
in Egypt (24:18, 22).

**Leviticus 19:13**: Again, the context (19:11-18) is about
the fair treatment of others, including the timely payment of
wages to hired servants.

These first two texts (Deuteronomy and Leviticus) are
directed toward *employers* who hire servants. Such employers are
often in a superior bargaining position and employees are at
their mercy to receive promised payment. Neither passage is a
proof text for a professional "*employee*" (the counselor) to
charge fees as a prerequisite for ministry to others.

**Luke 10:1-16**: Jesus Christ commissioned seventy (70)
disciples to preach the gospel, instructing them not to take
anything along because the people who received them would extend
hospitality.

**Matthew 10:5-15**: Similarly, Jesus Christ commissioned His
disciples to go to the lost sheep of Israel. They were not to
take along their own provisions, but rather to trust God. Their
material needs would be provided by those who received them.

These two texts (Luke and Matthew) are analogous to
ordained men who labor full-time in their ministry and receive
compensation from the churches that call them. The hospitality
they were to receive was extended voluntarily by those who
received them. There was no set hourly fee for preaching the
gospel. They did not condition individual ministry on the
payment of a fee. On the contrary, these disciples were told:
"freely you received, freely give" (10:8). Today, believers
voluntarily give to their churches as they are willing and able.
They are not "charged" a set rate for the preaching and teaching
of God's Word.

It is true that both Luke and Matthew contain strong
warnings to those who failed to receive the disciples.
Believers today have a responsibility to financially support
God's kingdom in the work of their churches, leaders, and
missionaries. It is biblical to preach and teach about that
obligation. However, that does not justify setting an hourly
fee as a condition to the ministry of God's Word, publicly or privately.
The shepherd and the sheep both have
responsibilities. Neither can make the obedience of the other a
prerequisite to fulfilling his own responsibility.

**1 Timothy 5:18**: The books of 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and
Titus all provide instruction concerning the qualifications and
duties of ordained men (pastors, elders, deacons). As verse 17
indicates, the "laborer" in verse 18 is a ruling elder who
preaches and teaches. While an ordained minister is entitled to
support from the body of Christ, nothing in the context supports
the idea that an individual believer should be required to pay a
set fee in order to hear the preaching and teaching of God's
Word, publicly or privately.

**1 Corinthians 9:9, 14**: Here the apostle Paul reiterates
the right of a full-time ordained man to compensation. This
comes in the context of a lengthy discourse wherein Paul
voluntarily waives that right. As in 1 Timothy, there is no
support for conditioning individual ministry on payment.

### 2. GOD'S INSTRUCTIONS TO HIS LEADERS

There are numerous passages that instruct and warn those
who are called to prophesy, preach, teach, and shepherd God's
flock:

**Isaiah 1:23**: This is a warning to rulers who love bribes,
chase after rewards, and pervert justice.

**Jeremiah 6:13-15**: Prophets and priests are rebuked for
dealing falsely and superficially healing the brokenness of
God's people. Everyone is said to be "greedy for gain."

**Ezekiel 33:30-33**: In this passage, it is the hearers
(counselees) who pretend to listen but are "greedy for gain."
However, leaders are still called to preach, teach, and minister
to them.

**Ezekiel 34:1-10**: Ezekiel is called to issue a scathing
prophecy against the shepherds who feed themselves at the
expense of God's sheep, allowing them to be scattered and
devoured by others instead of fulfilling their responsibility to
guard and care for them.

**Micah 3:5-12**: Micah is called to prophesy against Israel's
leaders, prophets, and priests who were leading God's people
astray. He takes them to task in verse 11 because they pronounce
judgments for a *bribe*, give instruction for a *price*,
and prophesy for *money*. These leaders essentially "prostituted"
their office for the love of money.

The Old Testament prophets were much like counselors,
bringing God's Word to His people. Their "counselees" were not
always willing listeners, but the prophets were nevertheless
called by God and obligated to continue preaching His Word in
spite of the response. Some of these "counselees" were
themselves leaders who placed their own interests ahead of the
people they were called to serve. It is difficult to imagine
Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, or any of God's prophets requiring
the payment of a fee prior to giving counsel.

**Acts 20:17-35**: Paul's farewell to the Ephesian elders
instructs us about the personal nature of the
counselor/counselee *relationship*. His description contrasts
sharply with the modern "professional" one-up/one-down
arrangement confined to an office setting. Paul went from house
to house (20:20), night and day for three years, with tears
(20:31). The phrase "house to house" implies that Paul
ministered privately the truths that he preached publicly on
other occasions, helping God's people apply the Word to their
lives. Today we might call this activity "counseling."

This Scripture is also instructive about *responsibility*.
Paul declares that he is "innocent of the blood of all men"
(20:26) because he has faithfully and consistently instructed
the Ephesians. He did not shrink from fulfilling his duty to
declare the "whole counsel" of God (20:20-21, 27). Moreover, he
admonishes his fellow elders to protect God's people from the
savage wolves who will come in to draw away disciples
(20:29-31). At no time is this solemn responsibility conditioned upon
the payment of a fee. It would be frightening to stand before
God and offer the counselee's failure to pay a fee as a valid
reason for not ministering God's Word. Failure to protect the
sheep from wolves, turning them away for lack of funds, would
surely render the "counselors" *guilty* of their blood (see
20:26). Money would surely be an improper motive for ministry
under these circumstances.

**1 Peter 5:2**: Peter instructs his fellow elders to shepherd
God's flock eagerly and *aiskrokerdos* (not for "filthy lucre" or
"shameful/sordid gain"). "Shameful gain" does not mean that no
one may ever engage in church-related work and receive support (see 1
Timothy 5:17-18). Peter is warning against
greedy or selfish motives. In the surrounding context, there
are three sins to avoid--sloth, desire for shameful gain, and
lust for power. Elders must shepherd God's sheep, not to
dominate or control them, but as godly examples; not for
shameful gain, but eagerly. Humility and sacrificial service
are common threads in these admonitions. Like the Old Testament
prophets (e.g., Ezekiel 34:1-24, Jeremiah 6:13-15, Micah 3:5-12),
Peter condemns the false shepherds who would use the sheep
to feed themselves and allow ravenous wolves to scatter and
devour them. Faithful shepherds, like Jesus the Good Shepherd,
*seek* the lost and wandering sheep. What sense would it make for
a shepherd to seek a wandering sheep and then charge him for the
service--or worse yet, charge him in advance? Back in John
21:16, Jesus instructed Peter about how to show his love for the
Lord: "Shepherd My sheep...feed My lambs...feed My sheep."
Notice that the sheep belong to God. They are *God's sheep*, not
John's, not Peter's, nor anyone else's. God cares for His
people through their love and care for one another.

All of these passages highlight the grave dangers of
allowing money to become the driving motivation or prior
condition for ministry. God's full-time leaders may be
reasonably compensated by the corporate body (the church) so
that they can support their families, but that does not justify
charging individual sheep as a condition to receiving ministry.

### 3. OTHER BIBLICAL EVIDENCE

Many additional passages shed light on the issue of whether
it is appropriate to either offer or accept payment for
ministry. Many of these Scriptures underscore the dangers in
mixing monetary motives with ministry.

**Judges 8:22-27**: Gideon refused to become king, saying that
God would rule over the people. However, he requested earrings
from the plunder. Gideon made the gold into an ephod. The
Israelites prostituted themselves by worshipping it, and it
became a snare to Gideon and his family.

**2 Kings 5**: Elisha's servant (Gehazi) wrongfully accepted a
gift from Naaman that Elisha had previously refused after
counseling Naaman regarding his leprosy. Naaman was an Aramean,
not an Israelite. Elisha refused the "fee" (gold, silver,
clothing) that Naaman offered after he was healed. Elisha was
not wealthy, but perhaps he did not want to be indebted to an
Aramean. Why was Elisha so angry with his servant Gehazi?
Would accepting a payment place a stumbling block in the path of
a young convert, or an unbeliever considering the gospel that
has been presented to him?

**Ezra 4:5**: Here is an example of "hired" counselors. These
are not God's servants caring for His people, but rather God's
*enemies* hiring counselors to frustrate the work of rebuilding
the temple.

**Deuteronomy 23:4-5, Numbers 22-23, Jude 11**: As in Ezra,
the Ammonites "hired" Balaam to curse Israel and were thereafter
excluded from the assembly. The account in Numbers 22-23
highlights Balaam's temptation to accompany the men sent by
Balak, king of Moab, and to accept the *fees* they offered him to
curse Israel.

**Acts 8:18-24**: Simon was severely rebuked by the apostle
Peter when he tried to use his money to purchase the Holy
Spirit. He attempted to "buy" what only God can give. The Holy
Spirit is not for sale, but is the free gift of God to His
people. There are lessons in this passage for both counselor
and counselee. Simon might be compared to a counselee
attempting to "buy" what cannot be bought or earned (8:20). He
expressed his intent to lay hands on others once he received the
Spirit (8:19). Was he planning to collect a fee for giving
others the Spirit? Possibly so, since he expected to acquire
the Spirit with money. Although we cannot judge the hearts of
those who counsel for fees (unlike Jesus and His apostles,
8:22), Peter's powerful rebuke should serve as a warning against
the merchandising of God's free gifts.

**Acts 19:23-41**: Idol manufacturers were alarmed by the
growth of Christianity, because it threatened their livelihood
and prosperity. Similarly, genuine biblical ministry to God's
people would put the psychotherapists (secular and "Christian")
out of business. But what about the biblical counseling
movement, and believers who charge fees for giving counsel?
There is a huge need for remedial work in this area. Many
believers, including pastors and other leaders, are in dire need
of education about the dangers of psychotherapy and the
sufficiency of God's Word. With so many churches referring
parishioners out to psychotherapists for counseling, some
individuals are desperately in need of ministry in order to
apply God's Word to their lives, and they may fall through the
cracks if their churches cannot be persuaded against
psychotherapy. (I was one of these.) The biblical counseling
movement is attempting to fill some of these gaps. However,
there is danger in building up biblical counseling as a *paid profession*,
requiring fees from counselees in order to sustain
itself, rather than a personal, voluntary one-another ministry
in the body of Christ. Money is a strong motivation. If
biblical counseling goals are truly achieved, and churches
undertake their rightful responsibilities to shepherd God's
flock, the apparent need for separate counseling centers, and
trained full-time counselors, should diminish dramatically.

**2 Corinthians 2:17**: Paul contrasts "peddling" God's Word
for a profit with speaking it sincerely.

**1 Thessalonians 2:3ff**: This text concerns pure motives for
preaching of the gospel, which God had entrusted to Paul as a
steward. Paul avoided flattery, greed, and the praise of men as
motives for ministry.

**1 Timothy 3:3, 6:10; Luke 16:13-14 (love of money)**: One of
the qualifications for an elder is that he not be a "lover of
money" (1 Timothy 3:3). Ministry is a calling, not a trade or
business. Paul cautions against the love of money, which is the
root of all sorts of evil (1 Timothy 6:10). The Pharisees
sneered at Jesus because He taught that no one could serve two
masters, namely God and money (Luke 16:13-14). People in full-time
ministry may receive support that is voluntarily given, but
that is not equivalent to charging fees as a prerequisite to
ministry. The latter may easily lead to improper monetary
motives. Consider the analogy to marriage/prostitution: a
husband supports his wife, but money must never be paid to
purchase sexual intimacy. The church supports its pastor, but
God's people should not be charged for ministry that the church
and its ordained leadership are obligated to provide (preaching,
teaching, discipleship, worship services, Bible studies,
individual ministry).

### 4. WHO IS THE "COUNSELEE"?

It is important to consider the identity of the person
receiving ministry. Some churches offer counseling as an
evangelistic outreach, so the counselee may be a skeptical
unbeliever. How will he react to being charged a fee to hear
the gospel--which must be presented before he has the ability to
understand and practice God's Word? Sometimes a believer is
trapped in sin and requires the sort of confrontation, or
"counseling," mandated by Matthew 18:15-20 (see also Galatians
6:1ff), and he will not necessarily be willing to hear, let
alone pay a fee. At other times, believers may seek wise
counsel because they truly want to grow in their walk with
Christ and live godly lives in the face of difficult situations.
Should the unbeliever be charged to hear the gospel he needs to
believe in order to have eternal life? Should the Christian
caught in sin be charged a fee for a message he may not even
want to hear? Should church elders forsake their biblical
obligations to initiate church discipline if the "counselee" is
unwilling to pay? Should the godly believer, struggling to know
and do God's will, be charged for personal ministry? This
latter believer may be the most willing to pay, but if he is
taught biblical principles of stewardship and giving, he will
contribute to his church according to his ability and additional
charges would place an unnecessary financial burden on him.

## IV. WORLDLY MODEL

Psychotherapists charge substantial fees for their
services. Counseling fees are their livelihood and they operate
outside the authority and oversight of the church. But if the
*content* is biblical, can (or should) biblical counseling be
conducted in a manner that in other respects simulates secular
"counseling centers"? Can individual believers engage in full-time
biblical counseling ministry and be paid a salary for their
time? Should centers be operated apart from church supervision,
and if so, how should they relate to the churches of their
counselees? Should such centers be managed like any other
business, charging fees to generate income to pay counselors and
other expenses? If a "center" is operated as a department of
the church, is it appropriate to require fees so the counseling
ministry does not dip into the church's general funds? What if
a counselee is a church member and already tithing or giving
even more generously to the church? How much should a biblical
counseling center, either inside or outside the church, mirror
its secular counterpart? In certain broad terms, there are
similarities. Both involve conversation. Both involve giving
and receiving counsel. Where does or should the similarity end?
Is content (biblical v. psychological) the only distinguishing
feature? These are all important, interrelated questions, but
this paper zeroes in on one issue: whether the recipient of
biblical counseling should be required to pay a fee.

It is worthwhile to consider an analogy between fee-based
counseling and prostitution. God ordained the institution of
marriage, wherein husband and wife become "one flesh" (Genesis
2:23) and are told to "be fruitful and multiply" (Genesis 1:28,
9:7). A husband provides financial support for his wife and
family (1 Timothy 5:8). Both prostitution and marriage involve
sexual intercourse, and both involve money, but the contrast
could not be more striking. Prostitution is a gross perversion
of God's plan for the union of male and female. What exactly is
the difference?

*Relationship* is a key factor, particularly the conditions
for initiating and continuing it. Marriage is a lifetime
covenantal commitment of love and faithfulness. Prostitution is
a temporary arrangement between people who may never see one
another again. The prostitute requires money as a condition to
sex. Husband and wife come together sexually in the context of
a God-ordained *relationship* accompanied by mutual *responsibility*
(Ephesians 5:22-33; Hebrews 13:4). "Professional" counseling,
like prostitution, requires money as a condition to providing
counsel. While the relationship may have more substance than a
prostitute and "client," it is often artificial and highly
restricted. Biblical counseling may depart from this model as
two people in a church form a counseling relationship quite
unlike its professional counterpart. But what happens if a
required payment is introduced as a pre-condition to ministry?
Counselor and counselee are brothers/sisters in Christ. What if
the counselee is no longer able or willing to pay a set fee for
the ministry of God's Word? What happens to the *relationship*?
No ministry relationship in the body of Christ should ever be
conditioned on the payment of money by the one receiving
ministry. Although full-time ordained leaders are entitled to
compensation so they can support themselves and feed their
families, such compensation is paid to them by the church and
does not involve charging a set hourly fee to individuals who
receive ministry, either publicly or privately. Believers have
obligations to support their churches financially, according to
their means (Malachi 3:8-10; 2 Corinthians 9:7), and church
leaders have spiritual obligations to care for God's flock
(Peter 5:1-5). Both are based on voluntary, joyful service
performed out of gratitude to God for His blessings.

## V. LEGAL LIABILITY[^1]

In addition to theological concerns, there may be increased
exposure to legal liability, depending on state statutes and
court decisions. "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a
duck," it is probably a duck. The more that pastoral counseling
resembles the professional model, including fees, the more likely
it is that a court will hold the counselor to the same
legal standard as licensed psychotherapist. (As Christians, of
course, we are held to a much higher standard: God's law.) A
couple of examples illustrate the point.

A Minnesota case in 2002 [*Odenthal v. Seventh-Day
Adventists* (Minn. 2002) 649 N.W.2d 426] allowed a negligence
suit against a pastor to go forward under Minnesota's rather
convoluted statutory scheme regulating "unlicensed mental health
practitioners":

> A "*mental health practitioner*" is a "person who
> provides or purports to provide, **for remuneration**, "mental
> health services" (defined by statute).
>
> The definition generally *excludes* clergy providing
> pastoral services to a congregation, BUT expressly *includes*
> clergy who are providing "mental health services," defined
> as: "psychotherapy and the professional assessment,
> treatment, or *counseling* of another person for a cognitive,
> behavioral, emotional, social, or mental condition,
> symptom, or dysfunction, including intrapersonal or
> interpersonal dysfunctions."
>
> The definition of "*mental health services*" *excludes*
> "pastoral services provided by members of the clergy to
> members of a religious congregation in the context of
> performing and fulfilling the salaried duties and
> obligations of a member of the clergy by that religious
> congregation."
>
> Prohibited conduct includes: (1) "willful or careless
> disregard for the health, welfare, or safety of a client;"
> (2) revealing confidential communications unless required
> by law; (3) continuing a professional relationship where
> "objectivity" is impaired.

The conduct involved in this case was egregious (the pastor
became sexually involved with the wife during the course of
marital counseling), but note how the presence of remuneration
subjects the pastoral counselor to a complex set of state
regulations and may obstruct efforts to resolve a counselor-counselee
dispute within the church according to biblical
principles.

North Carolina regulates the practice of "fee-based"
pastoral counseling, which is "to render or offer for a fee or
other compensation professional pastoral counseling services,
whether to the general public or to organizations, either public
or private; to individuals, singly or in groups; to couples,
married or in other relationships; and to families." N.C. Gen.
Stat. Â§ 90-382(5). "Fee-based professional pastoral counseling
services" is defined as:

> "The application of pastoral care and pastoral counseling
> principles and procedures for a fee or other compensation
> with the purpose of understanding, anticipating, or
> influencing the behavior of individuals in order to assist
> in their attainment of maximum personal growth; optimal
> work, marital, family, church, school, social, and
> interpersonal relationships; and healthy personal
> adaptation. The application of pastoral care and pastoral
> psychotherapy principles and procedures includes
> sustaining, healing, shepherding, nurturing, guiding, and
> reconciling; interviewing, counseling, and using
> psychotherapy, diagnosing, preventing, and ameliorating
> difficulties in living; and resolving interpersonal and
> social conflict. Teaching, writing, the giving of public
> speeches or lectures, and research concerned with pastoral
> care and counseling principles are not included in
> professional pastoral counseling services within the
> meaning of this Article." N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 90-382(6).

There is a limited exemption for ordained ministers
performing the ordinary duties of the clergy, but charging fees
as a prerequisite for counseling ministry certainly muddies the
waters and increases the risk of being held to the same legal
standard as a "professional" counselor in the event of
litigation. Moreover, a state-regulated pastoral counseling
practice would undoubtedly sacrifice some of the protections
otherwise available under the First Amendment for exclusively
religious activities.

In both of these cases, counseling fees may escalate the
potential for legal liability. Even where there are exemptions
for ordained clergy, many "biblical counselors" are non-ordained
believers who have received training in biblical counseling.
Individual states will differ as to their regulatory schemes for
licensing and imposing liability. Charging fees is quite likely
to have a substantial impact on legal liability.

## VI. COUNSELING OR DISCIPLESHIP?

Finally, is "biblical counseling" better viewed as intense
discipleship? Much one-another "counseling" in the body of
Christ is essential for spiritual growth and sanctification. It
is not an optional program, such as enrolling in a college or
seminary to earn a graduate degree in theology. Christ
commanded His followers to "go and make disciples," teaching
them to observe all of His commandments (Matthew 28:18-20).
When viewed as the discipleship mandated by our Lord, the
propriety of charging fees becomes even more questionable.

## VII. CONCLUSION - "COME TO THE WATERS"

Isaiah 55:1-2 is a gracious invitation to the weary and
worn to come to the "waters," to buy "without money and without
cost," rather than to spend wages for that which does not
satisfy. The invitation in this chapter is to seek God and His
Word. No financial transaction is in view. It is quite the
opposite! Our salvation has been bought and paid for by the
precious blood of Jesus Christ (1 Peter 1:19) and is offered
freely without charge. It is difficult to reconcile this
passage with the idea that God's sheep should be charged money
as a condition to the ministry of His Word.

The pastor, elder, or counselor is not the "hired hand" or
"employee" retained to perform services at the counselee's
bidding, but rather a servant of God, responsible to Him for the
care of *His* sheep. An ordained servant in full-time ministry
may rightfully receive support that is independent of who or how
much he counsels, but his shepherding of God's sheep must not
hinge on whether those sheep pay him a fee for services
rendered.

[^1]: ALWAYS consult an attorney in your own state who is familiar with your
particular situation. This section offers examples to illustrate the fact
that charging fees for counseling may be highly relevant to liability if a
counselee files a lawsuit.
