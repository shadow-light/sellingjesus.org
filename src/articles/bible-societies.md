## Early Charitable Bible Work in America

The Bible society movement in America began with a burst of evangelical zeal in the early 19th century, deeply rooted in the spirit of charity. The initial aim was straightforward: provide every person with access to the Scriptures as a part of ushering in the millennial reign of Christ. Inspired by the British and Foreign Bible Society (founded in 1804), the earliest American Bible societies viewed the free circulation of the Word of God as a sacred duty and a vital component of the Christian mission.[^1] Their goal, in their own words, was “the distribution of [the Bible] among persons who are unable or not disposed to purchase it.”[^2]

In their foundational documents and public addresses, these societies emphasized that bibles should be distributed “without money and without price” (Isa 55:1).[^3] The Connecticut Bible Society, for example, declared in 1808 that the Christian world had “never had opportunities of distributing the Bible equally favorable to those which present themselves to the present generation.”[^4] The Bible Society of Philadelphia (1809) confidently predicted that “before the present generation shall have passed away, the holy Scriptures will be read by all the principal nations under heaven.”[^5]

This spirit of free dissemination reflected their understanding of key biblical principles, especially Christ’s command to “freely give” (Matt 10:8). For early Bible societies, charity was not merely an activity, it was their very _identity_. As David Paul Nord summarizes it, “Their business was benevolence, not bookselling.”[^6]

By 1816, over 130 Bible societies had been established in various states and territories. Recognizing the need for a unified national effort, prominent figures like Elias Boudinot, a former President of the Continental Congress, and John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, advocated for the creation of a central organization to coordinate these endeavors. Their vision culminated on May 11, 1816, when delegates from 28 local Bible societies convened in New York City to establish the American Bible Society (ABS).[^7] From the beginning, the ABS was committed to sharing Scripture “without note or comment,” believing in its inherent power to transform lives.


## The Technological Shift: Stereotype Printing

Bibles were expensive to print with moving type. This led societies to embrace the latest emerging technology of their time: stereotype printing. This allowed for durable metal plates to be reused for mass production without re-typesetting. This innovation dramatically reduced the cost per Bible over time and improved the print quality.[^8]

The Bible Society of Philadelphia became a pioneer in this field. In 1812, they imported stereotype plates from England and launched a mass-printing operation. Within a few years, they had produced over 55,000 bibles and New Testaments, becoming a national supplier to smaller societies. The stereotype process became a hallmark of American Bible society publishing after 1816.


## More Money, More Ministry

Before Bible societies decided to become publishers, their operations had been simple. They purchased bibles from commercial publishers, and coordinated with “auxiliaries” to distribute them to the destitute. These auxiliaries were local congregations all over the U.S. that functioned as volunteer extensions of the Bible societies’ charitable mission. This system, however, was too slow for the Bible societies. The Philadelphia Society wrote:

> The number of families and individuals, who are destitute of a copy of the Scriptures is so great, that the whole of the funds in the possession of the Society, could be profitably expended in supplying the wants of this city alone; and the opportunities of distributing them in other places are so numerous, that if their funds were tenfold as great as they are, they would still be inadequate to satisfy the demand.[^9]

“With this grim scene looming before them, the managers of the Philadelphia Bible Society made a fateful decision. They would become publishers as well as distributors of the Bible.”[^10] In their estimation, more money equaled more ministry. Therefore, money had to be obtained—whether that be through commercial enterprise or donations. Impatience and ambition drove them to drastically increase their scale of operations through sales out of expedience rather than principle. This was accomplished through the sales of bibles.

They explained their reasoning as follows:

> The copies of the sacred scriptures, from your press, it is expected, from the excellence and beauty of the type, will be much superior to those which are generally in our market; and the managers have, at several meetings, deliberated on the question, Whether it be their duty to use the means which Providence has put in their hands for increasing your funds (all of which must be expended in gratuitous distribution of the sacred volume) by selling, at a moderate gain, to other persons, as well as to Bible societies, who may prefer their copies, and send orders. After mature consideration of this question, they have resolved, that…it is both their duty and their interest, to supply any orders that may be sent to them for Bibles.[^11]

Economic logic had prevailed over other scruples. With the shift to Bible-society-as-publisher came a new model: fund free distribution to the poor by selling to those who could pay.[^12]

Pragmatism eventually led to partiality and compromise. The leadership of the ABS wrote, “The Managers deem it expedient to renew their recommendation to the Auxiliaries to sell the Scriptures at cost or at reduced prices, in preference to distributing them gratuitously.”[^13]

The societies developed a form of differential pricing. There were premium editions for the trade, cost-covering prices for general buyers, subsidized rates for auxiliaries, and free copies for the indigent.[^14] This pricing model blurred the line between charity and commerce and eventually undermined the idea that Bible societies were strictly non-profit ministries.[^15]

By the end of the 1820s, the ABS had become one of the largest publishing houses in the country, nearly holding a monopoly over the production of inexpensive bibles in the U.S.[^16] Their stated goal remained evangelistic, but their methods mirrored those of commercial publishers. Bibles were now holy commodities. The American Bible Society, the American Tract Society, and the American Sunday School Union had become national publishing corporations, indistinguishable in business methods from secular enterprises.[^17]


## Criticism and Controversy

The shift from pure charity to market-driven strategies did not go unnoticed or unchallenged. Critics began to accuse the societies of hypocrisy. The 1830s saw a wave of opposition from those who believed retail sales betrayed the founding ideals of Bible work. One insider wrote _An Exposé of the Rise and Proceedings of the American Bible Society_, arguing that selling Scripture “mocked the claim of publishers to furnish Scripture ‘without money and without price’”[^18] (Isa 55:1). He pointed out that the societies had accumulated vast wealth in stereotype plates, real estate, and buildings, enriching themselves while claiming to serve the poor. The author wrote:

> The community had zealously assisted their spiritual teachers in the formation of this Society, on the supposition that it would dispense their charities collectively, to those who needed them, to much better advantage than they themselves could do individually. But in this the public were to be deceived. The benefit of the suffering community–suffering for the want of spiritual food, was of very minor consideration when compared with “the best interests of this Society.” Contributions and donations were pouring in from every section of this vast republic, for the purpose of _gratuitously_ furnishing the destitute with that which the benevolent said they most needed, viz. the Bible, when the Managers very gravely passed the following “Resolution,” which they unblushingly promulgated.
>
> “_Resolved, That in ordinary cases occurring within the United States, it is inconsistent with the best interests of this Society to distribute the Bible gratuitously, except through the medium of Auxiliary Societies._”[^19]

He then explains: “At a cursory view of this ‘Resolution,’ it may appear to some that this institution still furnishes the Scriptures gratuitously, though it may be through the medium of Auxiliary Societies. But such is not the fact.”[^20] Furthermore, he predicted that this new commercial approach “would render nugatory all competition.”

Other critics shared this concern about the impact on commercial publishers. By using charitable donations to subsidize low-cost Bibles, the societies were distorting the market and crowding out honest competition. As one polemicist asked, “What business have Christians to give their charity to do that which business enterprise and capital would do, if let alone, quite as well and cheaply?” His conclusion: “None at all.”[^21]

Even within the societies, some leaders came to recognize the problem. They admitted that under the sales model, _Scripture flowed primarily to those with money_ and undermined the charitable nature of their mission. Wealthier auxiliaries generated more sales and returned more revenue to the national office, while poorer regions remained underserved. “Ironically, the turn to retail sales, which was designed to produce universal circulation, not profit, had entrapped the societies in market forces they had been founded to resist.”[^22]


## Copyright and Proprietary Control

Amid this growing entanglement with market mechanisms, the question of intellectual property arose. Early Bible societies operated in a legal gray zone. The text of the King James Bible, their main version, was not protected by American copyright law, even though it remained under the perpetual [copyright of the Crown](https://sellingjesus.org/articles/kjv) in the United Kingdom. This empowered Americans to print the text of Scripture royalty-free and give it away without restrictions. But the publishing of copyright-free bibles would soon go the way of all flesh.

The book _Faith in Reading_[^23] shows the growing use of proprietary control mechanisms used by the ABS in the 19th century, such as the stereotype plates themselves. These costly plates effectively locked other societies into dependency relationships, because only those with access could print standardized editions. The plates functioned as a kind of analog copyright.[^24]

The Revised Version (RV or ERV, 1885) led to the advent of the first copyrighted Bible in the U.S. Published initially by the British, the RV was the first major revision since the 1769 Blayney revision of the 1611 King James. It became a transatlantic sensation. In May 1881, American newspapers rushed to meet public curiosity: the _Chicago Tribune_ printed the entire RV New Testament in a single Sunday edition, selling 107,000 copies of that issue.[^25] The Tribune freely used the biblical text from the British publishers, since no U.S. copyright prevented it. Rival papers did likewise.

Meanwhile, legitimate book publishers also raced to sell bound copies; over a million copies of the RV sold within months. This frenzy highlighted the possible profits that might be gained by copyrighting the text to ensure a monopoly on sales. It also revealed potential risks of having no copyright: anyone could reproduce or alter the text, which might result in errors or “tampered” editions. The stage was set for a shift in the stance of Bible publishers towards copyright.

Although American churches had enjoyed the British revision, they still wanted their own edition incorporating American-preferred renderings in the body of the text. However, an agreement had been made that the Americans would have to wait fourteen years before publishing such an edition. When the waiting period expired, the American Standard Version (ASV) was published in 1901 as the _“Standard American Edition of the Revised Version.”_ The preface states:

> It was agreed that, respecting all points of ultimate difference, the English Companies, who had the initiative in the work of revision, should have the decisive vote. But as an offset to this, it was proposed on the British side that the American preferences should be published as an Appendix in every copy of the Revised Bible during a term of fourteen years. The American Committee on their part pledged themselves to give, for the same limited period, no sanction to the publication of any other editions of the Revised Version than those issued by the University Presses of England… It now [1901] seems to be expedient to issue an edition of the Revised Version with those preferences embodied in the text.[^26]

This version was different in a critical way. It included a copyright notice with a nebulous reason: “to insure purity of text.” Later, the RSV preface explained:

> Because of unhappy experience with unauthorized publications in the two decades between 1881 and 1901, which tampered with the text of the English Revised Version in the supposed interest of the American public [by placing the American preferences into the main text rather than in the Appendix], the American Standard Version was copyrighted, to protect the text from unauthorized changes.[^27]

The first move to copyright the Bible really had nothing to do with true textual purity. The “unhappy experience” that motivated this change was simply the faithful adaptation of the text to American English. This change was “unauthorized,” but it did not introduce errors or heretical readings into the text. Thus, it can be concluded that the clause “Copyright, 1901 … TO INSURE PURITY OF TEXT” in the front matter of the ASV, was disingenuous. There were no reports of someone trying to commandeer the text for malicious purposes, or hostile parties corrupting the text in order to deceive readers, or cult leaders appropriating it for their own heretical ends. Instead, a petty squabble laid the foundation for a new tradition of binding the Word of God with the traditions of men. Ironically, after publishing unauthorized Americanized editions, Americans did the same again, but this time _officially_—and with a copyright restriction to prevent anyone else from doing to them what they did to the RV.

The copyright provided an economic reward for the publisher who underwrote the translation effort. Thomas Nelson’s financial support (≈$25,000) to the American revision committee was essentially repaid by granting Nelson exclusive publishing rights. The pious rationale of safeguarding “purity of text” conveniently aligned with securing a printing monopoly for recouping investment. But once the investment was repaid through sales, was the copyright lifted to drive prices lower and bless more people with the translation? No.

Dr. Maurice Robinson in his article _The Bondage of the Word_ writes:

> There was also a notice that Thomas Nelson & Sons was specifically “certified” to be the publisher of “the only editions authorized by the American Committee of Revision.” That copyright was renewed in 1929, but transferred to the International Council of Christian Education (the forerunner of the National Council of Churches) with both statements still attached. In fact, the original 1946 edition of the Revised Standard Version was also similarly copyrighted “to insure purity of text.” …
>
> Once the ASV 1901 had been successfully copyrighted in this country with no apparent legal challenge, the gate was opened, and nearly all subsequent Bible texts and translations followed suit. Permissions and royalty fees became the norm, since these were regularly required of all secular writings. But somewhere a great evil is involved whenever the people of God permit commercial publishers to hold hostage their sacred texts by copyright and licensing restrictions; for far too long the Christian community has been distracted from seeing the full implications of this matter, and the time is rapidly approaching when it may be too late to take reconstructive action.[^28]

By the late 20th century it was not uncommon to hear critics claiming that new Bible versions were merely “made for money,” often praising the KJV as superior because it could be freely reproduced. The view that modern translations are driven by greed is still alive and well.[^29] These accusations of profit motive and restrictive access have plagued new Bible releases from the NIV to the NKJV.

Defenders of the practice have countered that translation projects cost millions, and without copyright, few publishers could afford such work. And the proliferation of versions, each with its own copyright, has reinforced the notion that intellectual property is and should be a normal part of Bible publishing.

When the ministry of producing Bible translations became funded through sales, rather than the free generosity of God’s people, it [sabotaged the sincerity](https://thedoreanprinciple.org/#c6) of all institutions involved. Furthermore, they committed two sins: the sin of partiality (James 2:1-7) and the [sin of simony](https://sellingjesus.org/articles/simony) (Acts 8:18-19). What began as a mission to give the Bible away had evolved into a business model that required restricting others from freely doing so.


## The Legacy of Commercialization

By the end of the 19th century, the economic survival of Bible societies depended on sales, infrastructure investment, and, increasingly, copyright enforcement. The shift toward commerce had compromised the very principle that animated the Bible society movement: the idea that the Word of God must run freely, unhindered by human systems of control. The societies had embraced the market, not for profit, but for the sake of efficiency. Yet in doing so, they had also adopted the logic of exclusion and intellectual property.

Critics were not wrong to worry. “Scholars seem generally agreed that American religion plunged into the market world of the early nineteenth century.”[^30] As Bible publishers became awash in a sea of commercialism, the question of _“What will sell?”_ eclipsed all other priorities.


## Conclusion: Charity Entrapped

The transformation of Bible societies from charitable missions to commercial enterprises was not a single decision, but a gradual evolution driven by technological innovation, financial necessity, and the rationale of the market. The adoption of stereotype printing enabled mass production but required capital. That capital was raised through Bible sales. Differential pricing enabled both charity and commerce, but invited criticism and ended in dependency on market demand. Eventually, copyright and proprietary control followed.

What began as a pure mission to give away God’s Word became a hybrid operation—part charity, part business. The founding ideal, rooted in the freely given grace of God, still lingered in the rhetoric, but the economic structures told another story. The Bible societies had not become for-profit corporations in name, but they had become commercial enterprises in practice. And the Bible, once held to be a gift without price, now had a price tag attached—even if only to fund its own distribution. The ends had justified the means.

The legacy of that transformation continues today. Modern Bible societies rely on copyright to fund their operations and control their texts, often preventing others from freely copying and sharing the Scriptures. The challenge for the 21st-century church is to recover the original vision: that the Word of God may “run freely and be glorified” (2 Thess 3:1)—not just spiritually, but legally and economically as well.
