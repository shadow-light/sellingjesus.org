# Abolish the Jesus Trade

### Spread the Joy of Freely Giving

Years ago Randy Alcorn observed, “In the Christian community today there is more blindness, rationalization, and unclear thinking about money than anything else.” Abolish the Jesus Trade aims to help reverse this assessment. The Church is currently marked by underdeveloped thinking about Scripture’s teaching on money and ministry. The sale of the sacred has been normalized, not by prosperity preachers, but by conservative evangelicals. Busy building paywalls, we have torn down the sincerity of the Body of Christ.

Conley Owens, Jon Here, and Andrew Case present this collection of articles that seek to exalt the radical generosity of God’s heart, confront the commercialization of Christianity, and promote the biblical teaching that _ministry should be supported but never sold_. We are living in a time like the antebellum United States, where the majority of ministers regularly defended the slave trade from the pulpit, just as they defend the Jesus trade today. This calls for repentance, reform, and a return to Scripture’s primacy over economic expediency.

## Why we're giving printed copies for free
One of the distinctions we explain in this book is that if teaching is given freely, then [it's ok to charge for paper and ink](/articles/covering-costs). In practice, this means releasing teaching from copyright and making it freely accessible online, but we don’t expect everyone to give away printed books for free, as we are doing here.

So why _are_ we giving away printed copies? The reason for the biblical ethic against selling ministry is that it undermines the sincerity of ministry (2 Cor 2:17). While charging for physical copies is not necessarily insincere (as selling biblical teaching would be), it has the potential to suggest an ulterior financial motive.

We don’t want anything to cast doubt on the sincerity of the message we’re sharing. That’s why we don’t charge for printing or delivery—and we don’t ask for donations either. Again, we’re not saying everyone must do this; we wholeheartedly encourage financially supporting ministry. We’ve simply chosen this approach because of the nature of the topic we’re addressing.

While we can't afford to do this at scale, we provide everything needed to print in bulk should someone wish to, at the lowest cost possible.

If you have any questions about this, please read the book, because it's exactly the kind of thing it explores in depth—and it's free!
