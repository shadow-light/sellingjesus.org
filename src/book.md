# Abolish the Jesus Trade

### Spread the Joy of Freely Giving

Years ago Randy Alcorn observed, “In the Christian community today there is more blindness, rationalization, and unclear thinking about money than anything else.” Abolish the Jesus Trade aims to help reverse this assessment. The Church is currently marked by underdeveloped thinking about Scripture’s teaching on money and ministry. The sale of the sacred has been normalized, not by prosperity preachers, but by conservative evangelicals. Busy building paywalls, we have torn down the sincerity of the Body of Christ.

Conley Owens, Jon Here, and Andrew Case present this collection of articles that seek to exalt the radical generosity of God’s heart, confront the commercialization of Christianity, and promote the biblical teaching that ministry should be supported but never sold. We are living in a time like the antebellum United States, where the majority of ministers regularly defended the slave trade from the pulpit, just as they defend the Jesus trade today. This calls for repentance, reform, and a return to Scripture’s primacy over economic expediency.

## Why we're giving this book for free
One of the distinctions we explain in this book is that if teaching is given freely, then [it's ok to charge for paper and ink](/articles/covering-costs). In practice, this means releasing teaching from copyright and providing free access to it online. Whereas we don't expect everyone to also give away free printed books, like we are here.

_So why are we doing so?_ In order to evidence his sincerity, Paul gave up his right to all forms of support from the Corinthians (1 Cor 9:18; 2 Cor 2:17; 2 Cor 11:7,12) so there wouldn't be any confusion regarding his motives. We too do not want anything to cast doubt on the sincerity of the message we are trying to share. So we don't even charge for the cost of printing and delivery, and we don't request donations either. Again, we're not arguing that everyone should do this, we've simply chosen to do so because of the nature of the topic we are addressing.

While we can't afford to do this at scale, we provide everything needed to print in bulk should someone wish to, and are thankful for those who can offer such services at cost.

If you have any questions about this, please do read the book, it's free! As this is exactly the kind of thing we go into in depth.
