# Δωρεὰν Δότε
### _Freely Give_

In Matthew 10:8, Jesus said, “δωρεὰν ἐλάβετε, δωρεὰν δότε” — “freely you received, freely give.”

Many consider this a command that only applies to the first disciples. Many consider this a warm-hearted phrase about the general importance of generosity. But when we truly consider the text, it becomes evident that it is an eternal principle that demands the work of ministry be freely given to those to whom we minister. This is known as “[the dorean principle](https://thedoreanprinciple.org),” named after the Greek word that Jesus and Paul use to describe preaching without charge, “δωρεὰν” (Matt 10:8, 2 Cor 11:7).
