God has blessed their decision not to sell biblical teaching, but rather fund it through the free generosity of God's people. They serve as a model in this respect for others who doubt that God can fund large (or small) ministries solely through donations. We would encourage the Bible Project to delve more deeply into the vast array of biblical teaching on the issue of money and ministry, and apply biblical principles not only to their model of giving resources, but also to their perspective on intellectual property and copyright.

So far, with thousands of copies of \"The Dorean Principle\" distributed, and with thousands of hours of our content being consumed, and with many conversations we’ve had with people of diverse backgrounds who even have PhD ‘s and are professors in seminaries, we've never found anyone who can answer the logical inconsistencies we've pointed out clearly or satisfactorily. But we have heard plenty of sophistry when we ask simple questions about the Jesus trade, like: Is it ok to be peddlers of God’s Word in some contexts and not others? Why is it ok to charge to hear a sermon at a conference but not at church?  The answers we usually get are basically like saying, “Idolatry just depends on the context. It’s ok to worship idols as long as it’s not inside your local church.” This is why no one has offered any rebuttal to our call for reform in this area. No one is willing to debate because, we suspect, they know that they have no argument.<br><br>Want to have a friendly public discussion/debate about what we're asserting? We'd love to hear from you!
