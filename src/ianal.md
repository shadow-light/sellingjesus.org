# We Do Not Give Legal Advice

Because there is much interplay between copyright and the work of modern-day ministry, the resources we publish will often give [advice on how ministries should approach copyright](/articles/copyright-jesus-command-to-freely-give). This is intended as _ministry_ advice rather than _legal_ advice.  None of the regular authors here are lawyers, and you must apply any advice we offer entirely at your own risk.

However, we _do_ have an interest in the law, and we have attempted to educate ourselves on some of its details in order to help other Christians navigate practical matters.  While none of us would claim formal expertise in either national or international copyright legislation, it would be negligent to abandon this topic to “the experts.”

The saints will one day judge the world, so we are not incompetent to try trivial cases (1 Cor 6:2).
