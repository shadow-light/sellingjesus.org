This book comprises a curated compilation of articles published on [sellingJesus.org](https://sellingjesus.org) from 2023 to 2025. The _Selling Jesus_ initiative was established by three men who shared the conviction that the commercialization of Christianity needed to be addressed thoroughly and biblically. They decided to combine their gifts to serve the Church with comprehensive teaching on the subject in as many convenient formats as possible (video, audio, etc.). The aim was to maximize thoughtful engagement with a simple biblical message: _ministry should be supported, not sold_. Two years later, this compendium of their labor represents part of that ongoing effort.

The articles in this book have been arranged as follows:

1. __Conversations__: fictional conversations that introduce key foundations and ideas in a simple, dynamic style.
2. __Freely Giving__: discussions of Jesus’ command to freely give in Matthew 10:8, addressing common objections.
3. __Supporting Ministry__: how the Bible defines Christian ministry, as well as how it instructs us to fund it.
4. __Selling Ministry__: essays on different ways Scripture condemns the sale of ministry, buying ministry, and the use of ill-gotten gain from the sale of the sacred.
5. __Specific Passages__: exegesis of passages with great relevance to this topic.
6. __History__: what the Church has taught about the sin of simony throughout the centuries, and how Bible charity in America evolved into big business.
7. __Application__: from conferences to counseling, these articles address many concrete scenarios wherein the monetization of ministry prevails.
8. __Copyright & Licensing__: information and guidance on how to navigate intellectual property law biblically.
9. __Contemporary Commerce__: investigations into modern commercialization of the sacred, from Bible gatekeeping to blood donation.

While any chapter should be reasonably understood on its own, later chapters will be easier to follow in the context of the logical arguments built up from the beginning. For further foundations and explanations of the biblical basis for this book, we recommend reading _The Dorean Principle_ by Conley Owens, available for free at [thedoreanprinciple.org](https://thedoreanprinciple.org/).

We pray that this book serves to edify, challenge, and enlighten you through the scriptures. Our ultimate aim is love, “which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith” (1 Tim 1:5) — a love for Christ and his Bride, that we might all freely share the grace, truth, and blessing given by God’s Spirit.
