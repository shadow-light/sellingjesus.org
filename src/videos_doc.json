        "description_html": "What things are too sacred to be sold? Should Christian ministers ever charge money for things like worship music, preaching, teaching, or counseling? What does the Bible say about selling spiritual ministry?<br><br>This video explores the biblical teaching called the \"Dorean Principle,\" which says that accepting support for Christian ministry as anything other than an act of colabor compromises its sincerity. In other words, ministry should be supported but never sold.<br><br>We look at key passages like Matthew 10 where Jesus tells his disciples \"Freely you have received, freely give,\" as well as examine Paul's writings on how gospel ministers have a right to be supported, but not through a reciprocal, pay-for-service transaction.<br><br>Just as Old Testament priests were provided for through free-will offerings, rather than charging for their work, those who preach and teach God's Word today should avoid the model of selling/commercializing spiritual things.<br><br>Although there might be gray areas around what specifically constitutes \"ministry,\" there are clear applications, like rejecting any payment for preaching a sermon, celebrating communion, or praying for others.<br><br>Ultimately, the goal is for the church to better reflect the abundantly generous heart of our Creator by abandoning any sale of spiritual things, and instead relying on the free support of colaboring believers.<br><br>Read or listen to a free copy of \"The Dorean Principle\" at <a href=\"https://thedoreanprinciple.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://thedoreanprinciple.org</a><br>Learn more at <a href=\"https://sellingJesus.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://sellingJesus.org</a>"

        "description_html": "Our purpose here is to highlight and exalt the radical generosity of God’s heart, confront the commercialization of Christianity, and promote the biblical teaching that ministry should be supported but never sold. We want to explore the history of how we've gotten to the point where it's the respectable default to monetize ministry, and take a deep dive into the Scripture’s teaching on the subject. We believe our evangelical cultural moment has a serious blind spot in this area, and we hope to be a voice of reform. Overall, we seek to take seriously what Jesus commanded in Matthew 10:8: “Freely you have received; freely give.” <br><br>It’s important for you to know that at the core of all of this we want to take the time to revel in the beauty of God’s generous heart! The very fabric of Scripture sings with the glory of a God so radically generous that he freely gave us life, a universe of splendor, rain and sunshine, the laughter of children, the sweetness of his word, and even his only Son. All without charging us a subscription fee. We want God’s example to be our north star. He is our joy and treasure.<br><br>Put simply, we want to help people understand the difference between selling ministry, which Scripture condemns, and supporting ministry which Scripture commends.

        "description_html": "Should churches charge admission fees? Most Christians today would recoil at the idea but struggle to point to anything in Scripture that would condemn such a practice. And many people have forgotten that churches used to commonly rent out pews, even though we'd condemn such a thing today. The arguments used to defend this practice back then are eerily similar to how Christians today defend selling things like Christian books and media, Bible conferences, worship events, biblical counseling, and seminary education.<br><br>But why does the sale of other things like the Lord’s supper, prayer, or baptism, feel wrong to us at a gut level? Can we clearly articulate from Scripture why it's an issue? Surprisingly, most Christians actually struggle to explain what's wrong with charging money for access to these things.<br><br>Yet a close look at the Bible shows that Christian ministry should be supported, but never sold. Christ commanded us to give freely (Matt 10:8). Jesus and the apostles were remarkably clear about how gospel ministers should be supported without selling their message or putting a cash price on blessing others. There's a better way to sustain Kingdom work generously without reducing the gospel to a commercial commodity. Let's let Scripture recalibrate our thinking.
